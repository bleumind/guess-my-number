Hello! This is a project I found on a udemy course. HTML and CSS were provided for me, however I self wrote the javascript file to make the game function properly.

How To Play:
1. Guess a number 1-50.
2. The game will tell you whether your guess matches the secret number or if you need to guess higher/lower.
3. You have 10 guesses then you lose.
4. A high score will be created, you can try to beat your high score by pressing the "Try Again" button.
