Hello! This is a project I found on a udemy course. HTML and CSS were provided for me, however I self wrote the entire javascript file and customized it to make the game function properly while increasing the difficulty. I also changed the html and css slightly to fit my customized js file.

How To Play:
1. Guess a number 1-50.
2. The game will tell you whether your guess matches the secret number or if you need to guess higher/lower.
3. You have 10 guesses then you lose.
4. A high score will be created when you guess the secret number.
5. You can try to beat your high score by pressing the "Try Again" button.
